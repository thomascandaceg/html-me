<article> 
   <p>My professional journey began at The University of TN at Martin. I majored in Biology with the goal of attending Pharmacy shcool in the near future.
I soon changed my Major due to the misunderstanding that I had with Chemistry. Five years later I graduated with an Education degree in Early Childhood 
Education Pre-K - 3.  After teaching for 4 years I enrolled at Union University in the Masters program for Instructional Leadership. Soon after I graduated 
and obtained a license in Educational Leadership. However, I do not want to be a Principal of a school. Then, I saw the ad for LaunchCode and decided to apply.
When I was selected to participate in Launchcode I was so excited. The excitment left around the first due assignment. Eventhough, I have been on pins and
 needles/nail bitting kringes to figure out the code I am still here and successfully writing code.</p>
                                                                                                        

<h2>Memory Lane</h2> 
<article> A couple of years ago I became a Jeweler with Premier Jewelry. The Jewelry Company is set up to where you are an Independent Jeweler.  Twice a year the company 
 hosts a Company Rally to introduce the new jewelry and to motivate the Jewelers to get top sales. My first Rally was wonderful. I flew on an airplane for the first time.
 The plane ride was the worst adventure I have been on yet. I was severly ill on the plane and for a week after the trip.  When we first took off in the air I looked over
 to my mother for support and held her arm. As I looked to her to say I'm scared she pushed me off of her and had the scariest look on her face like she had seen a monster.
 My mother continued to say "DON'T TOUCH ME" We still laugh about this but I was so hurt at the time. I was a million miles in the air with no one to comfort me.</article> 

<h3> Hobby/ No Hobby</h3>
 <article>A new hobby of mine is watching Netflix. I know Netflix shouldn't be a hobby but trying to find a movie, sitcom, tv series has become a hobby. Once I find a series or movie 
 it takes me a month or two to finish watching it due to my small window time to watch TV. I also fall alseep and then I have to replay it again.  Netflix is the best thing 
 since sliced bread. </article>
